# React Fan Facts

A simple React project built from the Scrimba learn-react course. It displays fun facts about React and demonstrates basic React setup and component usage.

🧾 About This Project

This repository contains the full final version of the React Fan Facts project from the Scrimba course.
It was migrated from an earlier repository — originally part of a larger learning repo:
# https://github.com/didier-bazayesu/react-phase2-understanding-

Because this is a completed project migration, the repo may have one initial commit with the finished project rather than a detailed commit history. This is intentional and reflects the fact that the learning and development took place previously.
